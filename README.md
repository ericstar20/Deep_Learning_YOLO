# Deep Learning YOLO - Basketball Detection

__Motivation__:\
As both basketball and machine learning enthusiast, I really want to combine these two elements in a project.\
Therefore, I used the YOLO algorithm to detect the basketball in a video and track the ball as it moves around in the video frames, drawing its previous positions as it moves. (you can see the result below)

In this project, I used Python, OpenCV, Google Colab, and LabelImg.

Below is my project's flow chart

## Important Resourses
This is my first deep learning project. And as we all know, Deep learning is a complicated file and as a novice like me, it's impossible to finish this project without research and tutorials. Therefore, I want to give a big big thanks to below resources I used. This project cannot be done without them!/
Highly recommended if you are new in deep learning.
